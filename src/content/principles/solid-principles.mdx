# SOLID Principles Explained

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP**)**

A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
