# The Singleton Pattern in Modern JavaScript

The Singleton pattern is one of the most well-known design patterns in software engineering. It ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Implementation in JavaScript

Here's a modern implementation using ES6+ features:

```javascript
class Singleton {
    static #instance;
    
    constructor() {
        if (Singleton.#instance) {
            return Singleton.#instance;
        }
        Singleton.#instance = this;
    }
    
    static getInstance() {
        return new Singleton();
    }
}
```

## Use Cases

1. Configuration Management
2. Database Connections
3. Logging Services

## Best Practices

- Use private fields for better encapsulation
- Consider using dependency injection instead
- Test for thread safety in concurrent environments
